## Introduction

In modern web development, integrating multiple web services is a common requirement. This project provides a robust solution for integrating various third-party APIs, microservices, and other web-based resources into a single server environment. The goal is to simplify the process of managing these services and ensure smooth communication between them.

## Features

- **Multiple Service Integration**: Easily integrate multiple web services such as payment gateways, social media APIs, cloud storage, and more.
- **Centralized Management**: Manage all integrated services from a single server.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale with your application's needs.
- **Security**: Built-in security features to protect sensitive data and API keys.
- **Customizable**: Highly customizable to fit specific project requirements.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dantls/server-web-services-integration.git
   cd server-web-services-integration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:
   ```env
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can start integrating web services by following the examples provided in the `examples/` directory. Each example demonstrates how to connect to a specific web service and perform common operations.

### Example: Integrating a Payment Gateway

```javascript
const paymentGateway = require('./services/paymentGateway');

paymentGateway.charge({
  amount: 100,
  currency: 'USD',
  source: 'tok_visa',
  description: 'Example charge'
}).then(response => {
  console.log('Charge successful:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Charge failed:', error);
});
```

## Configuration

The project can be configured by modifying the `config.js` file located in the `config/` directory. This file contains various settings such as API endpoints, timeouts, and retry policies.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  paymentGateway: {
    apiKey: process.env.PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
    timeout: 5000,
    retryPolicy: {
      maxRetries: 3,
      retryDelay: 1000
    }
  },
  // Add more service configurations here
};
```

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API Documentation](docs/API.md) file. This document provides comprehensive information on available endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling.
